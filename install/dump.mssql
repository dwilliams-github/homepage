(142, 'Thingamablog and .Mac', '\nIt is easy to appreciate the strange appeal of writing a `blog <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blog>`_. \n\nI did start another blog some while ago. The reason was to practice my writing skills regularly, as suggested by one of instructors in a fiction `writing course <http://continuingstudies.stanford.edu/course/egl121.asp>`_ I took at Stanford (which, by the way, was a great deal of fun and something I would suggest to anyone who loves to write). But that blog quickly fell into disuse due to a lack of time. Now that I am between careers, I have a good deal of free time, and so I figured this was a great time to try to get a little more serious with a blog. \n\nSo, what is the appeal? Everyone likes to feel a little important. If we write our thoughts down in a public place, we give the opportunity to reach out to the internet at large. Maybe people will read them. Maybe a few people will appreciate them. \n\nI love playing with software, so of course I had to search for a nice fancy way of publishing blogs. This is where `Thingamblog <http://thingamablog.sourceforge.net/>`_ comes in. It is `open source <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/open_source>`_ `freeware <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freeware>`_, which is nice, and is pretty surprisingly easy to use. If you are technologically savy, you already know that this web site is `hosted by Apple <http://www.mac.com>`_. The built in `syncing software <http://www.apple.com/dotmac/sync.html>`_ including with my Mac makes publishing the blog pretty simple and reliable. If you want to try this yourself, the only confusing part is identifying the \"base path\" and \"base url\". This is an example of what they should look like: \n\n* Base path: \"/Volumes/iDisk/Site/blog\" \n\n* Base url: \"http://homepage.mac.com/\'accountname\'/blog\" \n\n\nwhere \"\'accountname\'\" is your .Mac account name. \n', 1, '2006-04-21 11:11:59', '2006-04-21 11:14:18'),

The stage hands were still putting the finishing touches on the lighting just minutes before the doors were opened. Despite all of that, it turned out very well.

I quote: \n\n \"æit has the potential --a vast potential -- to dramatically cut our dependence on foreign oil. Hydrogen is clean; hydrogen is domestically produced; and hydrogen is the way of the future.\" \n\nDomestically produced? Well, hydrogen is only an energy carrier, not a source of energy. Sure, we can \"produce\" hydrogen, but that requires energy. Lots and lots of energy. And exactly where is this energy supposed to come from? \n\nLet\'s look at some numbers: \n\n* Gasoline. The United States currently consumes about `383 million gallons of gasoline per day <http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/5atab.html>`_. Each gallon of gasoline provides roughly `110 megaJoules <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gasoline>`_ of energy. \n\n* Power. The last nuclear power plant brought online in this country is the `Watts Bar <http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reactors/wattsbar.html>`_ reactor. It produced about 8.5 million megawatthours in 2003, equivalent to 3.1<<10^10 ^megaJoules of energy. \n\n* A modern automobile gasoline engine is about `37% <http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/atv.shtml>`_ efficient. The best hydrogen fuel cells, in contrast, manage about `80% <http://www.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/basics.html>`_ efficiency. Let\'s assume that the hydrogen car has a 100% efficient electric motor (terribly optimistic) and the same drive train, braking, and aerodynamic drag energy losses as modern cars. \n\n* Now let us be wildly optimistic and assume that conversion of nuclear energy is only 20% less efficient than the generation of electricity, and let\'s also assume that the energy costs of transporting and storing hydrogen is just as small as gasoline (both of these assumptions rely on the development of new technology). \n\n\nIf I put all of these (optimistic) numbers together, I conclude that to replace the gasoline used today (completely ignoring diesel fuel), we need 270 new nuclear power plants the same size as `Watts Bar <http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/at_a_glance/reactors/wattsbar.html>`_. \n\nThat\'s right. 270 nuclear power plants. \n\nOh, by the way, did I mention that the Watts Bar nuclear power plant took 24 years to build? \n', 1, '2006-04-24 15:19:00', '2006-04-24 23:58:24'),

The resulting little essay turned into a bit of a rant. In the process of putting together this little rant I learned how to write like someone who is not part of the high-energy physics community, which is sort of a new feeling. \n\nThe high-energy physics community is so messed up.

(147, 'The future of high-energy physics in the US, according to the National Academies', '\nBecause our government is so poor at long term planning, I was impressed when the `NSF <http://www.nsf.gov/>`_ and `DOE <http://www.doe.gov/>`_ sponsored a study from the `National Academy of Sciences <http://www.nasonline.org/>`_ on a fifteen year program for high-energy physics. The `results of this study <http://www4.nationalacademies.org/news.nsf/isbn/0309101948?opendocument>`_ became available today. The main points of the report are: \n\n* If current trends for funding for high-energy physics continue, we (the US) will cede our leadership in the field. \n\n* Current priorities should focus on the `LHC <http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/>`_ program in Europe. This appears to be in contradiction to the above point and is a recognition that this country may already have lost its edge. \n\n* As a future priority, the US should aggressively pursue the construction of the proposed next generation facility, the `ILC <http://www.linearcollider.org/cms/>`_, at the `Fermilab <http://www.fnal.gov/>`_ national laboratory (in this country). Despite budgetary constraints, the US should try to obtain sufficient funding to accomplish this. \n\n\nThere have been many reviews over the years of the high-energy physics program in the US. Most notable are the efforts of the `Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel <http://www.er.doe.gov/hep/subpanel%20list.shtm>`_ (affectionally known as \"P5\"), a subpanel of the `High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel <http://www.er.doe.gov/hep/hepap.shtm>`_ (HEPAP). However, these reviews have been internal, and were performed by physicists inside the community. Thus, their impartiality were always under some suspicion. \n\nWhat is different about the Academy review is that it was (at least in part) external. Many of the members of the review committee had little or no prior experience in the field. This gives their report more force. However, there are concerns that if the report becomes too closely connected with the current adminstration, it may do more damage to the field than good. \n', 1, '2006-04-26 19:37:08', '2006-04-26 19:39:28'),

I no longer had Thingamablog on my computer, but I was pretty sure that I had all of my original user files. So I poked around a bit to see if something obvious stood out.\r\n\r\nWhat I found on my computer was a directory called \"database\" in my \"Documents\" directory that was filled with a bunch of files with names that started, funny enough, with \"database\". One file called \"database.script\" has SQL commands for creating tables like \"AUTH_TABLE\" and \"FEED_TABLE\" which definitely identified the files as associated with my blog. Another file called \"database.properites\" looked like a bunch of configuration parameters and began with \"#HSQL Database Engine 1.8.1.3\". So I checked Google for a SQL capable database called \"HSQL\" and found a java-based database engine called `HyperSQL`_ that looked like a match.\r\n\r\nBefore going any further, I copied all of the database files to another location (to keep the originals safe and sound). I then downloaded an `ancient version`_ of `HyperSQL`_ to match the version indicated in my files. After a bit more research, I figured out that the following magical invocation in a terminal window (on my Mac OS machine) brought up a database browser::\r\n\r\n java -cp hsqldb/lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManager\r\n\r\n(If you are using a newer version of `HyperSQL`_, the command might be a little different—check the documentation for your version.) The first thing the browser shows when it starts is an utterly confusing dialog box. After more research, and a lot of trial and error, I figured out the following settings opened my old blog database file:\r\n\r\n========= ===============================\r\nParameter Setting\r\n--------- -------------------------------\r\nType      HSQL Database Engine Standalone\r\nDriver    org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver\r\nURL       jdbc:hsqldb:file:/xxxxxx/database/database\r\nUser      SA\r\nPassword  (blank)\r\n========= ===============================\r\n\r\nwhere \"xxxxxx\" is the absolute path to the directory holding the copied database directory.\r\n\r\nOnce I used the correct set of magical parameters, the database browser presented me a list of four tables. The one of primary interest had the cryptic name \"ENTRY_TABLE_1145640371555\" (I assume Thingamablog associated \"1145640371555\" with a blog name). I then asked the browser to run a simple query::\r\n\r\n SELECT * FROM ENTRY_TABLE_1145640371555\r\n\r\nBoom! The contents of all of my old articles appeared in the browser (see the figure above). Now all I had to do was use the menu item \"Save result csv\" to make a csv text file of all of my old blog articles.\r\n\r\nNow that I had all of my old stories in text format, I only needed to write a python script to convert and insert them into the `mysql`_ database of my blog.

(284, 'Cookies, yum!', 'I have been working on polishing up my new web site in my spare time this week, and I have been uncovering little details here and there that need work. One detail I bumped into was the look of my `web error pages`_. The web server software I am using has built in error pages, of course, but they are standard, boring pages, and don\'t fit into my web site style at all.\r\n\r\nWeb site designers often go to some trouble to personalize their error pages with their own `special look`_. Because error web pages don\'t come up very often (or at least, aren\'t supposed to), to put a lot of effort into them is a sign of thoroughness. And being the perfectionist that I am, I had to do the same.\r\n\r\nI started by constructing a prototype using a `CSS`_ layout that nicely matched the style of my web site. I then just quickly composed some \"suggestions\" for users who might have gotten a web page url incorrectly, including a suggestion that was a joke about getting a cookie (everyone likes cookies). I was quite happy with how the web page layout turned out, especially considering how quickly it was coded. But it was entirely in text, and it seemed something was missing. Maybe a picture.\r\n\r\nI then had the inspiration to add a picture of a cookie (to play off the cookie joke in the text). So I peeked at some pictures of cookies in the public domain. Some were okay (others weren\'t), but none had the right composition. So I felt at a bit of a loss. Until I had another inspiration!\r\n\r\n`She Who Must Be Obeyed`_ is an excellent baker, and a `prolific photographer`_. So I asked her to make some chocolate-chip cookies to my specifications: just the right size and shape. And they were perfect! (And, incidentally, really, really delicious.) I then experimented with various materials to photograph cookies on, in order to reproduce the approximate shade of the background of my web pages (\'#333\'). A black piece of paper worked fairly well. I found that natural lighting looked far better than flash, and then set up an impromptu studio in the bedroom (with a simple tripod made from old boxes). After some trial and error (and getting just the right bite in the right cookie), I had the perfect picture.\r\n\r\nThe image I had in my mind was a chocolate-chip cookie sitting on top of the web page. To get that image right, I had to convert the background of the picture into the html color #333. That is were `GIMP`_ comes to the rescue. `GIMP`_ is a well known `open source`_ image manipulation program with capabilities similar to `Adobe Photoshop`_. Being an amateur user, it took a few tries to get a natural look, but I think it `turned out pretty good`_ in the end.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this story is that if you are looking for just the right look in your web page design, and can\'t find a good picture in the public domain, consider making one yourself. It can be a bit of fun, and educational. And in some cases, you can get added benefits like a entire batch of yummy chocolate-chip cookies.\r\n\r\n.. _`web error pages`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes\r\n.. _`special look`: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/29/404-error-pages-one-more-time/\r\n.. _`CSS`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets\r\n.. _`She Who Must Be Obeyed`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumpole_of_the_Bailey\r\n.. _`GIMP`: http://www.gimp.org/\r\n.. _`open source`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software\r\n.. _`Adobe Photoshop`: http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\r\n.. _`turned out pretty good`: /thisisnotareallink\r\n.. _`prolific photographer`: http://picasaweb.google.com/104541193529144014707\r\n', 1, '2011-09-18 14:53:12', '2011-09-18 14:53:12'),

(287, 'What\'s With the MTU?', 'Anyone with experience engineering software or hardware understands what most of the public takes for granted: it is a tremendous effort to build complex devices that are reliable. The usual approach is to subdivide an implementation into components in order to make the task manageable. Complex components are divided into sub-components, which are then divided again if necessary, *ad infinitum*. Even the most complex problem, divided correctly into its trivial components, becomes manageable. Usually.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, the MTU, or `Maximum Transmission Unit`_. The MTU is the largest size object that can be transmitted by a digital communication device. The MTU is an important parameter for the internet, because the internet is build upon millions of hardware devices all interconnected and all of which (in principle) have different values for the MTU. There are an entire collection of protocols designed to keep the internet up and running that deal with possible MTU disparities. Protocols that each device has to adhere too if the network is to work at all.\r\n\r\nThere are `billions`_ of internet users, but very few know about the MTU. Miraculous!\r\n\r\nThis brings me to the point of this story. It turns out that my home computer, a relatively recent `Mac mini`_, has had some bizarre wireless ethernet problems. When I first installed this computer at home, if I left it on for more than a couple of days, the wireless would slowly start degrading. A simple `ping`_ to the wireless router would start showing dropped or badly delayed packets. The longer the computer stayed on, the more common these lost packets became. A simple reboot brought wireless performance back to normal.\r\n\r\nI spend hours trying to figure out what was wrong, but could not find anything out of place. Another similar computer at home worked fine, so the problem wasn\'t directly related to the router. The problem had nothing to do with interference or the choice of wireless channel, since a bad wireless connection that persisted for hours was fixed in minutes by a reboot. Temporarily turning off encryption made no difference. I eventually decided that the problems must be some obscure hardware problem. I suppose I could have returned the computer, but it was easier just to turn it off every night and avoid the issue.\r\n\r\nThen I installed `Mac OS Lion`_, and suddenly reboots stopped fixing the problem. That was pretty upsetting, so I started to do more research. I finally found one change that permanently fixed wireless performance: setting the MTU of the wireless connection of the computer from \"Set Automatically\" to a fixed value of 1400. The computer has been on for weeks and no problems have reappeared.\r\n\r\nSo, why is my poor computer so sensitive to the MTU setting? I have *no idea*. Hardware problems? Maybe, I suppose. A hardware problem that some how confuses the algorithm which chooses the optimal value of MTU (for the \"Set Automatically\" setting)? A little more likely. But I have no proof. Nor is there much evidence that other Mac users had discovered similar problems.\r\n\r\nAn annoying mystery, but at least my computer works properly again.

Here is a quote from NPR:\r\n\r\n \"Shirley feels after a short time, that she is not really getting the attention she needs from Dr.  \r\n Wilbur,\" Nathan explains. \"One day, she walks into Dr. Wilbur\'s office and she says, \'I\'m not \r\n Shirley.  I\'m Peggy.\' … And she says this in a childish voice. … Shirley started acting like she had a \r\n lot of people inside her.\"\r\n\r\n -- Real \'Sybil\' Admits Multiple Personalities Were Fake, NPR, October 20, 2011\r\n\r\nSo, now Dr. Wilbur gets to study an interesting, new, diagnosis of a disorder of particular interest and Mason gets all of the attention she craves from the doctor. And so the fiction continued as Dr. Wilbur started injecting Mason with sodium pentothal and more and more personalities were \"uncovered\".\r\n\r\nHow long was Dr. Wilbur fooled? Nathan doesn\'t say, but suggests that once the book was drafted, the potential financial reward was so big that Wilbur couldn\'t turn back even as it became clear the personalities weren\'t real. Plausible, I suppose, but I wonder if Wilbur knew in the back of her mind that she was accidentally manufacturing the whole diagnosis from the start.\r\n\r\n.. _NPR: http://www.npr.org\r\n.. _review: http://www.npr.org/2011/10/20/141514464/real-sybil-admits-multiple-personalities-were-fake\r\n.. _book: http://www.amazon.com/Sybil-Exposed-Extraordinary-Multiple-Personality\r\n.. _Sybil: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_(book)\r\n.. _multiple personality disorder: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder', 1, '2011-10-26 22:07:09', '2011-10-26 22:07:09'),

Released in 2003 and originally planned to expand into multiple servers, the gamed ended up serving only a small population on a single server (Al`Kabor). Oddly enough, though, this one, unique Everquest server has remained up and running ever since, serving a small but fiercely loyal Macintosh fan base. Meanwhile, the PC version of Everquest (which was always incompatible with the Mac version) has received multiple `expansions`_ and a completely rewritten client. \r\n\r\nThe Mac client, originally written for Mac OS 8 and the PPC processor, received only one update early in its life. It continued to run, however, on Mac OS X, and, later, on intel processor, thanks to the `Carbon`_ and `Rosette`_ compatibility environments provided by Apple. That is, it ran fine until `Rosette`_ was discontinued in the latest version of Mac OS.\r\n\r\nFinally, eight years after it\'s release, Everquest on the Mac no longer ran on new Macintosh computers. It seemed that the game was doomed.\r\n\r\nBut then something very odd happened. Someone high up at `Sony Online Entertainment`_ decided the game was worth saving, despite its tiny player base. So, after eight years of neglect, a `new port`_ was approved. \r\nIn a era when online games `collapse and fail`_ in an eye blink, one odd, strange, and somewhat exclusive online game manages to hold on to life.\r\n\r\n.. _Everquest: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest\r\n.. _expansions: http://www.everquest.com/\r\n.. _Carbon: http://developer.apple.com/carbon/\r\n.. _Rosette: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_(software)\r\n.. _new port: http://www.eqmac.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=10782\r\n.. _Sony Online Entertainment: http://www.soe.com/\r\n.. _collapse and fail: http://www.qj.net/mmorpg/news/lego-universe-blocked-up-closing-down.html', 1, '2011-11-17 23:10:43', '2011-11-17 23:10:43'),

To make matters worse, there was basically only one person who knew how to keep the client up and running, an unacceptable situation for any publicly available game platform.\r\n\r\nThe player base, in a desperate push to save the server, started a letter-writing drive. Soon after, the president of `Sony`_ Online Entertainment, the infamous `John Smedley`_, `responded`_ with a personal apology and hints of the option of porting the current PC client to the Macintosh, allowing the Macintosh server to survive in an upgraded form.\r\n\r\nThen the truly amazing happened: just a mere fourteen days after the initial shutdown announcement, `John Smedley`_ personally `announces`_ that the Mac server will be converted to free to play and kept up indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear what changed this decision, but I doubt it was the passionate pleas of the player base alone.

I was even more shocked to find out that the BMI was incorporated into the clinic\'s electronic record keeping. The final blow came when the Doctor herself looked up my weight and height and issued a diagnosis to me in person.\r\n\r\nThe BMI originates from a statistical analysis performed almost `200 years ago`_ (according to Jeremy Singer-Vine from the `Slate`_) and updated in 1972 by a researcher named `Ancel Keys`_. Keys wisely cautioned against using the results for individual diagnosis. So I supposed he was probably dismayed when the BMI started getting used for just this exact purpose by doctors everywhere.\r\n\r\nSo why use a `flawed diagnostic`_ like the BMI at all? Because it is cheap and easy, and the insurance industry will use any information that is cheap and easy, no matter how inaccurate. And once a practice gets ingrained in medicine, no matter how ill advised, it seems to stick around forever.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that there is growing `evidence`_ that using a combination of waist size and height can be turned into a useful index for individuals, and since waist size is almost as easy to measure as weight, perhaps we can finally say goodbye to the BMI.\r\n\r\n.. _Body Mass Index: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index\r\n.. _200 years ago: http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2009/07/beyond_bmi.html\r\n.. _Slate: http://www.slate.com/\r\n.. _evidence: http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7409238n\r\n.. _flawed diagnostic: http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106268439\r\n.. _Ancel Keys: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancel_Keys', 1, '2012-05-24 21:49:40', '2012-05-24 21:49:40'),

Such social behavior might begin as a search for comfort, because people are lazy and fearful and it takes effort to appreciate other points of view (take, for example, the popularity of political cable channels like `Fox News`_ and `MSNBC`_). What starts as comfort can progress to reinforcement. The internet has made it easier than ever to reach out to fellow believers, accelerating this tendency in modern times.\r\n\r\nA good example of this social phenomenon are religious cults. A more dangerous example are some political movements.\r\n\r\nThere are two recent examples that come to mind.\r\n\r\n`Nate Silver`_ is a statistician who earned a reputation over many years for his accurate political projections, based on sound mathematics and logic. He `predicted Obama\'s recent presidential win`_ with almost patronizing confidence. Nate Silver\'s rational, objective analysis `infuriated`_ many pundits on the right.

This was the golden opportunity for the `NRA`_ to become part of the solution, and they blew it. How was this possible?

Some of the most frantic `protests`_ from the more libertarian and technically minded organizations on the web have suggested that the NSA programs are illegal. Unfortunately, much of the sentiment behind these protests are missing the real question.\r\n\r\nWe know that the government and police are allowed to spy on citizens if there is good enough cause. The classic example are phone `wiretaps`_ performed under `warrant`_. Few people are against these legal, law enforcement tools. And few people would be against similar means on electronic communication, such as e-mail.\r\n\r\nUnlike phone taps, which requires a technician to fiddle directly with wires, technology makes spying on individuals very easy in the internet age. This is good in some ways, because it makes the government\'s job easier, and we want government to be efficient. It is also bad in other ways, because if spying is so trivial, it becomes more open to potential abuse.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the subject of `PRISM`_. If the current descriptions are true, the `PRISM`_ project is of breathtaking scope. That said, has anyone found any evidence that information from `PRISM`_ has been used illegally to harass any citizen?

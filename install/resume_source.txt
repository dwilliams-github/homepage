programs as needed.


Postdoctoral Researcher, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 1994–2006
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Contributed to the search for SUSY using signatures associated with missing
energy as a member of the ATLAS Collaboration. Explored various topics in
Charm physics, such as D0 mixing and charm spectroscopy, as a member of the
BaBar Collaboration. Served as co-convener of the BaBar Charm Analysis Working
Group. Developed the BaBar Geant4 detector simulation. Explored topics in
proton computed tomography as a member of the pCT Collaboration. Explored
various topics in diffraction, deep-inelastic scattering, and exotic physics

Providing a page of web links is a bit quaint these days,
but I've have such a page in one form or another since 1991, 
so I guess you can call it a habit of a sort.

# [Mathematics and Algorithms](#math)

Nothing makes a Physics geek smile more than online, on demand
[solutions](https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/integral-calculator/) to integrals.

If you do any numerical computation, you probably know about
[Numerical Recipes](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-3rd-Scientific-Computing/dp/0521880688). 
But, did you know that it is now freely available 
[online](http://numerical.recipes/)?

I used to use [LINPACK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK) on mainframe computers 
back in the dark ages. It's a little amusing that it (and its cousin LAPACK) is still 
considered by many as the state-of-the-art for numerical linear algebra.

# [Programming](programming)

Finally, a good, free [programming editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that runs just about
anywhere. Just pretend you didn't know it came from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/).
By the way, if you are curious how it works, you can take a peek at all the
details on [github](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

Well, some say its ruined interviewing for computer science jobs, but [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
is still a good way to learn algorithms. If you are new to programming and find their
examples bewildering, you can pick up the python language with no prior experience at
[learningpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).

[UC Berkeley](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/) has an excellent Computer Science department, 
and you can take advantage of it [for free](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/coding/online/landing)
with just a web browser.

# [Comics](#comics)

There is a great [collection](https://hiveworkscomics.com/) of web comics available, 
all free of charge. Some of my favorites are [Girl Genius](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php#.XWszRi2ZOL4) 
and [Stand Still, Stay Silent](http://www.sssscomic.com/).

# [Writing](#social)

Curiously enough, the best directory of science-fiction short story publishers I have found on the web is 
in the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_magazine).

If you are brave enough to submit your story to a publisher (and you should be!), make 
sure you use the [correct format](http://www.sfwa.org/category/manuscript-formatting/) for your manuscripts.
